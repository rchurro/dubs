title: "Saying Goodbye to my Pi Cluster"
categories: pi cluster

Since I've decided to upgrade my cluster. I've decided to sell my old pi cluster  I've had a lot of fun with it and it makes me a little sad to put it up for sale. I learned how to run docker swarm and portainer on it and started my homelab hobby running over 20 stacks including: 

- swag - reverse proxy with https on everything
- duckdns - so I can maintain my services when I'm away from home 
- nextcloud - because google is shiesty and stopped google photos (I get it though) 
- jellyfin - so I can watch stuff
- remote access software - webtop for desktop access and shellinabox for faster cli access

I also dabbled with some other stuff for funs. Here's just a few more that I played around with that were interresting: 

- babybuddy - even though my kids are not babies anymore, I wanted to check this out... I wish they had this a few years ago when my kids were babies
- transmission - to torrent stuff of course
- node-red - to learn api stuff 
- snapdrop - very cool fileshareing through browser a la airdop style
- vaultwarden - password safe


Anyways, I loved the pis so easy to set up ... so cheap.... so little space... so low power... etc. I gotta mention one thing that made it so fun was this thing called a clover pi. [CloverPi_Link](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cloverpi/cloverpi-take-your-raspberry-pi-to-the-next-level). It really made it very manageable. 
I debated about selling the clover pi since I don't think the guy makes any more of them. That's one of the cool reasons I love kickstarter stuff... sometimes you get something kinda special and limited runs. I also bought a few things from the next thing company. (pocket c.h.i.p). but that's for a different blog post. 

Anyways that it for now.
