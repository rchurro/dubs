<meta name="description" content="So for the past few days I’ve been feverishly searching for venues that we can afford when you take into account the cost of food coupled with what it takes to actually feed people–like having tables, chairs and silverware. I know weddings can be expensive, but this is ridiculous! If you don’t want to feed your guests Little Caesars or take out on paper plates, you’re out of luck finding something affordable under $40 per plate in Southern California. I nearly succumbed to doing a backyard wedding and having a restaurant or family just cook the food, only we don’t have a backyard big enough to host the party and I wouldn’t want my poor mom and family to slave over cooking and not enjoy the wedding. Anyway, if all goes well with the church stuff then we can finally book a place. Fingers crossed in hopes that they have the date available and we can afford it o_o." />
