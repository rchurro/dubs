We just got back from our honeymoon yesterday! It was truly a wonderful experience. We can’t wait to do it again. We’re also super tired, so we’re trying to sleep off the jet lag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for coming to see us on our wedding day! We felt so blessed and loved with all the family and friends who came and those who were there in spirit. We couldn’t have asked for anything better. We feel so fortunate and we are eternally grateful for everyone who contributed to help make such a special day happen particularly our families, parents, brother, sisters, God Parents, cousins, and great friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I do not currently have pictures from our photographer, but I’ve seen a few pictures from our family on facebook, so feel free to check there and friend me if you haven’t already. I’ll be posting a few pictures from our honeymoon as soon as I get them sorted out. It was a little hard to get internet access while in Europe and we barely had time to backup our files let alone post them :\ so I’ll do my best to have a few of them on here 🙂 Here’s one of our pictures from our gondola ride in Venice, Italy!&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7410/9351819516_d54b1a13d2_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a few loose ends here and there and a vendor or two to finish paying, but so far so good. I will have to say that planning this wedding on our own has made me feel like an expert planner already hah! Anyway, we hope to see all of you–family and friends. We’ll be sure to post pictures of the day, and if possible when we go to our honeymoon to Europe right after. So exciting!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>rchurro</name></author><summary type="html">I can’t believe time has gone by this quickly and in a little over a week we will be married!

&lt;p&gt;Things left to do include getting the final schedule/ideas sent to our video/photog people and DJ, finding a makeup and hair person, and what to do with the bouquets? I’m tempted to make them myself, but I’ve been advised against it. We’ll see how that goes. So far Arturo and I have mastered the art of DIYing.

&lt;p&gt;On a side note, as I’ve been feeling the crunch of 6 months left, I bit the bullet and looked at dresses on NYE. After 8 dresses, I “said yes to the dress”. That’s one more thing down and several more to go. Hopefully my friends &amp;amp; family can pull through in the end. As much as I hate asking for help &amp;amp; relying on others, a wedding just isn’t right without your friends &amp;amp; family having your back.&lt;/p&gt;
